## Synopsis
2D, sprite tile-based, action-adventure, sandbox side-scrolling game featuring exploration (along with a day-night cycle), crafting, construction, and combat again both players and creatures found in the world.

## Gameplay
The player(s) will begin with simple character creation. Once completed, they will be met with a procedurally generated world (based on a random seed), one of the many that the players may create. The player will begin armed with a wood shortsword for self-protection, a wood pickaxe for mining, and a wood axe for chopping down trees. Incentive to gather resources is emphasized as the first day of the player's new world session begins at noon -- and night is when the monsters come out (and they're not friendly!). The player can build a base, hunt for enemies, and gather resources both above and below ground.
